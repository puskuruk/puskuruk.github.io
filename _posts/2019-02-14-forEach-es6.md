title: forEach Function in ES6
layout: post
---

ForEach function is like map function because of this I want to explain with object. In this object we defined prices we spend for person when we explored the city. After that we wrote to console what we spend for person and we wrote to console what we totally spend.

```javascript
let  pricesForPersonWhenWeExploreTheCity = {
	coffee: 12,
	cinema: 18,
	breakfast: 80,
	lunch: 90,
};

let prices = Object.values(pricesForPersonWhenWeExploreTheCity);
let totalPriceForTheDay =  0;

let countPricesprices = prices.forEach((price) => {
	totalPriceForTheDay += price
});

prices.forEach((weSpend) => {
	console.log(`We spend ${weSpend}TL for person`);
});

console.log(`We totally spend ${totalPriceForTheDay*2}TL`);
```

Output of this code:

```javascript
We spend 12TL for person
We spend 18TL for person
We spend 80TL for person
We spend 90TL for person
We totally spend 400 
```
