Let we think you bought 125 gram coffee beans and you grinded these beans 5 different sizes. In this code we will calculate you have how much total brewed coffee from each sizes.

```javascript
let weightOfGroundedBeans = [
  10,
  16,
  25,
  40,
  34
];

const totalBrewedCoffeeWeight = weightOfGroundedBeans.map((weightOfGroundedBeans, index) => {
  let waterRatio = 14
  console.log(`"Receipe ${index+1}'s total brewed coffee weight: ${weightOfGroundedBeans*waterRatio}ml"`)
});
```
Output of this code:
```javascript
"Receipe 1's total brewed coffee weight: 140ml"
"Receipe 2's total brewed coffee weight: 224ml"
"Receipe 3's total brewed coffee weight: 350ml"
"Receipe 4's total brewed coffee weight: 560ml"
"Receipe 5's total brewed coffee weight: 448ml"
```
